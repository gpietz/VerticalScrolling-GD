# Vertical Scrolling Demo in Godot

After the C++ and Rust version of this project I wanted to try the same in godot. i used GDscript to achieve the project goal even though i had no experience in it. Most of my time was spent researching the appropriate commands.  
Maybe now I should try the ports to Unreal Engine, Unity and CryEngine.... doooh better not :)
